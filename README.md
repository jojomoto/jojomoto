Hello! My name is Joseph. After losing many projects in the past, I have decided to finally create a Github account. As of Oct. 2022,
I have started some new projects and will be commiting my mostly finished programs here. This account will have some Python, HTML/CSS, 
Solidity, Java, JavaScript, and much more. Python will most likely be the most frequent language you will find currently (It is my favorite).
However, I have been working in Solidity a lot lately and am excited to commit some projects I am working on. I hope you enjoy some of
my work.
